# Homework 4

## Problems 1 and 2

Problems 1 and 2 are contained in the file hw4.ipynb. Problem 1 is computing convolutions and problem 2 is applying max pooling to a matrix.

## Problem 3

Problem 3 is to adapt the notebook pretrained_convnet_finetuning.ipynb into two notebooks that apply a new convolutional base and use different dense layer configurations for the output layers. The first implementation of this is contained in the file hw4.3.1.ipynb, and the second in hw4.3.2.ipynb.
